          At my bossâ€™s house in Saudi Arabia, I contemplated how to get out of
          the rat raceâ€”the 9 to 5, as many call it. I didnâ€™t know freelancing
          existed. I didnâ€™t know people could get paid to write, or even that
          people got paid online... Yep, it was 2022, and I had no idea.
